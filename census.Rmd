## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Census}
st_pums <- get_pums(variables = c("PUMA", "FINCP"), state = "Massachusetts", recode = TRUE, survey = "acs1", year = 2019)
st_pums |>
group_by(PUMA) |>
summarize(total_pop = sum(PWGTP), pct_income = sum(PWGTP[FINCP < 12880])/total_pop) |>
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = pct_income, y = fct_reorder(PUMA, pct_income))) +
geom_point() +
theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3)) +
labs(x = "Rural Population Proportion", y = "")
```
